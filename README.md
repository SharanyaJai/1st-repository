" Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as though you were working for the Lord and not for the people " (Colossians 3:23)

<br>I, Sai Sharanya Jaishankar, a budding Software professional,  have indefatigable faith on the saying above!

<br>Well,lemme introduce myself ! An Undergrad, currently pursuing Computer Science and Engineering, aspiring for excellence and recognition in the field chosen.Neither a bookworm, nor a flippant! I envisage myself as a Doctorate in the near future and intend going to the States for my Masters.
<br>In short, a balanced and diligent worker embedded into a basically foodaholic-shopaholic-happy-go-jolly type person !
